# Introduction

## Reminder

Economic consensus: agents respond to incentives

Two versions:

Fully Rational / Limited Rationality / Rational Inattention

Behavioural World: systematic deviations from rationality

## Carbon Tax

Oeconomic Rational

-   modify the system to provide the right incentives
-   first best: tax carbon
-   otherwise: modify constraints to make carbon de facto more expensive
    -   examples

Should work well for rational agents: especially *firms*...

## Another perspective:

-   directly affect people's decision context to affect their behaviour

## Examples:

.../.

-   a nudge: a cheap, ...

# Behavioural Economics

## System 1 vs System 2

## Incentives vs Nudges

# Deviations from rationality

## The (neo)-classical view

- Agents are perfectly rational...
  - they don't make errors
- ...and pursue their self interest
  - they are selfish


## The ultimatum game

::: {.center}

![Split the Bill](assets/ultimatum.jpeg){width="60%"}

:::

##

[TODO] graph of the protocol

__Setup__

Two players negotiate over a fixed amount of money (the pie):

- player 1 demands a proportion of the pie
- player 2 sees the size and player's 1 demand and either rejects or accepts it
  - accept: split is implemented
  - reject: both players get 0

## {auto-animate="true"}

![Results](assets/ultimatum.png)


## {auto-animate="true"}

![Results](assets/ultimatum.png){width=60%}

- hundreds of papers since original one by Guth et al.
- consistent results: average offer is 40%, offers below 20% have high chances to be rejected, lots of 50-50
- note that the "rational choice" for both agents would be 99-1!
- it is an example of __other regarding preferences__ (aka altruism)


## 

What determines the split? What influences altruism?

. . .

Can you devise an experiment to measure the effect of "shame"? 


## The ultimatum game: measuring shame

Improved protocol

- for half of the candidates, exactly as before (*control group*)
- for the other half (*treatment group*), the two players, don't see each other don't have any contact. Only the demand from player one is communicated to player 2.

Result:

- -> players are less generous but the result holds

## Reflection Effect or Loss Aversion

![](assets/loss_aversion.PNG)

- Result from literature
  - first lottery: 92% chose B
  - second lottery: 80% chose A
- Intepretation:
  - agents are risk-seekers when it is about loosing money
  - agents are risk-averse when it is about winning money


## The Certainty effect / The Allais paradox

![](assets/certainty_effect.PNG)

- Result from literature
  - first lottery: most people choose A
  - second lottery: most people choose B
- Intepretation: people underweigh outcomes that are merely probable compared to those that are certain

## Expected utility

- Expected utility framework
  - simple assumptions on people's preferences
  - agents maximize $U(x)$ where  $U$ is increasing and concave
  - standard in economics and finance
- Concavity implies that agents are risk agents are risk averse

## Prospect theory

# Some Behavioural Anomalies


## Behavioural anomalies

We classically distinguish two kinds of behavioural anomalies

- predisposition towards error
- mental shortcuts (aka __heuristics__)

They have been studied by psychologists for a while

- And are being revisited systematically by economists/psychologists
- ...following the "replication crisis"

__Setup__ (Study from Lord, Ross & Leeper, 1979)


*48 undergraduates supporting and opposing capital punishment were exposed to 2 purported studies, one seemingly confirming and one seemingly disconfirming their existing beliefs about the deterrent efficacy of the death penalty. As predicted, both proponents and opponents of capital punishment rated those results and procedures that confirmed their own beliefs to be the more convincing and probative ones.*

::::

:::: fragment

__Result__

*Participants gave higher ratings to studies that confirmed their initial point of view even when studies on both sides had been carried out by the same method. In the end though everyone had read all the same studies, both those who initially supported the death penalty and those who initially opposed it reported that reading the studies had strengthened their beliefs*.

__Test__:

- Write down 3 examples of successes that you have had
- Write down 3 examples of failures
- What were the causes of the success?
- What were the causes of the failures?


::::
:::: {.fragment}

__Interpretation__

- Attribution bias *occurs when people attribute their success to skills, and
their failures to randomness* (Taleb 2001)
- It is when we attribute praise/blame to the person rather than the situation.
*However, successful people can also mistake hard work for luck. Timing can be important but so is developing the skills
to be able to take opportunities when presented. After all, “the harder you practice, the luckier you get”* Gary Player

People place a higher valuation on an asset, purely by owning it.

__Example__: We tend to think that footballers make more money than dentists, but only because we don't see the failures (there’s a selection bias)

- Dentistry is a more lucrative profession since it maximises your expected income across all alternative histories
- *One cannot consider a profession without taking into account the average of the people who enter it, not the sample of those who succeed* Taleb (2001)

__Example__: Following the Exxon Valdez oil spill, people were asked how much they were willing to pay for equipment that would do the following:

- Save 2,000 birds: <span class="fragment data-fragment-index=2"> $80 </span>
- Save 20,000 birds:  <span class="fragment data-fragment-index=3">  $78 </span>

# Green Nudges

## 


::: {.callout-important title="Nudge (economic definition)"}

A *nudge* is defined as a change in the decision environment that influcences people's behavior without prohibiting any choices or significantly changing the economic incentives

from *Thaler and Sunstein*, 2009

:::


## 

`
Originally, the role of nudges was to counteract poor choices made by individuals, in areas such as personal savings and health`



Traditional: improve welfare of agents: a behavioral solution to a behavioral problem. 

Green nudge: influence people's behavior, through changes in the choice architecture, in order to reduce negative externalities: a behavioral solution to a traditional economic problem.


## Classification

![](assets/classification.png)

## Cognitive Nudges

Cognitive nudges: correct for bounded rationality, inattention of self-control. Make it easier to "do the right thing".

For instance, help individuals with self-control problems, present-bias....

Example of cognitive self-focused nudges: put healthy food at the top of a restaurant menu.

Example of cognitive green nudge: does not assume that individuals make poor choices for themselves because of bounded rationality.  But it workds because individuals have cognitive or self control limitations.

*bounded rationality or self-control could lead an individual defaulted into a green tariff to stick  with the new socially desirable default.*

## Moral Nudges

A moral nudge draws on people’s social preferences, their desire for status, to follow norms or to have a positive self-image. The nudge rewards “doing the right thing” by providing the individual with moral (dis)utility. 

## Compare with the neoclassical agent

Cognitive Nudge: help agent solve optimization
Moral Nudge: affects agents preferences

| Nudge Type                                  | Example                                                             |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Defaults                                    |   If I manage to summarize that in a few words, will that fit?      |
| Simplification of information and salience  |         |
| Changes in physical environment             |         |
| Reminders                                   |         |
| Social comparison                           |         |
| Normative appeal and peer pressure          |         |
| Commitment and goal Setting                 |         |

## Defaults

The default effect refers to the tendency of people to stick with an alternative already chosen by
someone else, even when the cost of making an active choice is very small.

Why does it work?

::: {.incremental}

- people interpret the default as a suggestion from someone better informed
- lowers the cost of a decision (from no-decision to the default)
- loss aversion or status quo bias make people stay with the default

:::

Thermostat story: lower standard from 20...

::: notes

Famous example of prosocial default nudge: organ donors.

:::

## Simplification of Information and Salience

example: consumers pay little attention to fuel and electricity costs compared with the sales prices they face when buying cars or lightbulbs.

- labels, order in which the information is presented


## Changes in the Physical Environment

example: reduce food waste in buffet restaurants using smaller plates

few academic and adequately statistically powered evaluations of such nudges.

## Reminders

A reminder increases attention to a decision and reduces forgetfulness. However, reminders can also impose moral costs if
they draw attention to a decision that the decision maker would rather avoid (Damgaard and
Gravert, 2018). For example, being reminded can create guilt and/or cognitive dissonance.

electricity bill, which is a type of reminder, on hourly electricity
consumption. They found a .6–1 percent reduction in electricity consumption following receipt
of the bill

## Social Comparisons and Social Preferences

the extent to which social information affects behavior depends not only on the actual information
regarding what others do (i.e., descriptive messages) but also on whether it conveys approval
of certain behavior (i.e., injunctive messages).

A series of randomized field experiments aimed at water and energy conservation suggests
that the provision of both descriptive and injunctive messages can affect individuals’ behavior
by reducing water and electricity use

 study by Delmas and Lessem (2014), who studied the effect
of both private information to the household and public information to all neighbors on
electricity use. They found that only a combination of private and public information had an
effect on energy use (a 20 percent reduction). S

## Moral pleas / moral suasion

Ito, Ida, and Tanaka (2018), moral suasion was used to reduce energy use during peak hours. The following
message was received by some households: “Substantial energy conservation will be required
for the society during critical peak-demand hours in summer and winter.”

Electricity use was reduced by around 8 percentage points in the moral suasion group and by
around 15 percent by the households that received economic incentives. However, the effect of
moral suasion diminished quickly when repeated, while the effect of the economic incentives
did not. In Egebark and Ekström (2016), a moral message was provided in order to reduce the
use of printer paper, but no effects were found.

## Commitment and Goal Setting

Harding and Hsiaw (2014) investigated how voluntary goal setting concerning electricity
savings affects actual electricity use and found that those who set a realistic goal save more
than those who set a too low or too high goal.

. In Baca-Motes et al. (2013), some hotel guests were given the opportunity to commit to acting more sustainably and received a pin enabling them to signal commitment. Treated guests were more likely to reuse their towels than those who were not
asked to commit. The effect of the commitment was stronger if they received a pin, and it was
also stronger if the commitment was more specific (reuse towels) than general (act in an
environmentally friendly way)
