# Introduction

## Reminder

Economic consensus: agents respond to incentives

. . .

Two versions:

- Fully Rational / Limited Rationality / Rational Inattention

- Behavioural World: systematic deviations from rationality

## Carbon Tax

For rational agents:

-   modify the system to provide the right incentives
-   first best: carbon tax
-   second best: modify constraints to make carbon de facto more expensive

. . .

Should work well for rational agents: especially *firms*...

# Green Nudges

## 


::: {.callout-important title="Nudge (economic definition)"}

A *nudge* is defined as a change in the decision environment that influcences people's behavior without prohibiting any choices or significantly changing the economic incentives

from *Thaler and Sunstein*, 2009

:::


## 

`Originally, the role of nudges was to counteract poor choices made by individuals, in areas such as personal savings and health`

. . .

__Traditional Nudge__: improve welfare of agents: a behavioral solution to a behavioral problem. 

. . .

__Green nudge__: influence people's behavior, through changes in the choice architecture, in order to reduce negative externalities: a behavioral solution to a traditional economic problem.


## Classification

![](assets/classification.png)

##

__Cognitive nudges__

Correct for bounded rationality, inattention of self-control. Make it easier to "do the smart thing".

For instance, help individuals with self-control problems, present-bias....

\ \ 

. . .

Example: put healthy food at the top of a restaurant menu.

It does does not assume that individuals make poor choices for themselves because of bounded rationality.  But it works because individuals have cognitive or self control limitations.

##

__Moral Nudges__

A moral nudge draws on people’s social preferences, their desire for status, to follow norms or to have a positive self-image. The nudge rewards “doing the right thing” by providing the individual with moral (dis)utility. 

. . . 

Example: *bounded rationality or self-control could lead an individual defaulted into a green tariff to stick  with the new socially desirable default.*



## Compare with the neoclassical agent


$$\max_{s.t. h(x)\leq0} U(x)$$

__Cognitive Nudge__: help agent solve optimization

__Moral Nudge__: affects agents preferences

## Defaults  {auto-animate="true"}

![Default Browser](assets/default_browser.png)


The __default effect__  refers to the tendency of people to stick with an alternative already chosen by someone else, even when the cost of making an active choice is very small.



## {auto-animate="true"}

![Default Browser](assets/default_browser.png)

Why does it work?


::: {.incremental}

- people interpret the default as a suggestion from someone better informed
- lowers the cost of a decision (from no-decision to the default)
- loss aversion or status quo bias make people stay with the default

:::

![Egebark and Ekström (2016)](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeejeeman/v_3a76_3ay_3a2016_3ai_3ac_3ap_3a1-13.htm) change the the default on computer printing behavior: simplex to duplex

Result:

- consumption of paper dropped by around 15
percent
- no indications that the effect was any smaller 28 weeks after the change had been introduced

## {background-color="palegreen"}

[Brown et al. (2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140988313000753)

Change the default temperature on thermostat for OECD employees
from the standard 20 °C to a lower default. 
 
Result:

- 1-degree decrease resulted in a lower average temperature initially, the effect disappeared and went into the opposite direction after a few weeks.

::: notes

Famous example of prosocial default nudge: organ donors.

:::


## Simplification of Information and Salience

Decision makers are *innatentive* to  certain informations and make therefore suboptimal decisions.

Example: consumers ignore fuel and electricity costs when buying cars or lightbulbs.

. . .

Note that this can correspond to:

- __limited rationality__: agents lack cognitive power
- __rational innatention__: since acquiring and processing information is in general costly, it might be rational to ignore some

Is it really a nudge ? Or just release of information?

![](assets/polar_bear.gif)

In [Tiefenbeck et al.](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2646) (2016), real-time feedback on  energy use, in the shower, was given in the form of an animation of a polar bear standing on melting ice.

. . .

-> reduced the average shower time by 22 percent

. . .


::: notes

Is it salience/ availability bias? Or emotion?

:::

## Changes in the Physical Environment

The design of the physical can nudge people to the preferable behaviour, or give clues on appropriate conduct.

. . .

\ \ 


The topic is under-studied despite some famous examples.


##  {background-color="palegreen"}

![](assets/platesize.jpg)

Kallbekken and Saelen (2013): in a buffet restaurant, 50% smaller plates led to a reduction of around 20% of food consumption.


## Reminders

![](assets/reminder.jpg)

A reminder increases attention to a decision and reduces forgetfulness. 

. . .

Can have unexpected effects:

- draw attention to a decision that the decision maker would rather avoid
- create guilt and/or cognitive dissonance

## Social Comparisons and Social Preferences

We have seen that individuals exhibit __other-regarding preferences__

In econ, there are several associated concepts/theories:

- altruistic motive
- consumption externalities / conspicuous consumption (keeping up with the Jones)
- positional preferences
- ...

## 

![](assets/message.jpg)

In behavioural economics we posit that *social informations* (information about others) impact individual's behaviour.

Social information can be classified between:

- *descriptive message*: this is what others do
- *injunctive message*: this is the appropriate behaviour

How are they different?

::: notes

descriptive: activate immitation mechanism, fomo, social norm (default)
injunctive: what is socially acceptable? what is ok? (ex: if I'm told others pollute too much, what should I do?)

:::

## {background-color="palegreen"}

![Consumption Dashboard](assets/dashboard.png)

[Delmas and Lessem (2014)](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeejeeman/v_3a67_3ay_3a2014_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a353-370.htm)

At UCLA students don't pay for energy bills.

How to reduce water and electricity consumption with a cusom dashboard for each room?

## {background-color="palegreen"}

Provide feedback to users with:

- realtime individual consumption (private information)
- position w.r.t. mean consumption (descriptive social information)
- public information: *Ratings for each room (red/green were made public with large, prominently displayed posters, posted on each floor*

. . .

Authors found that *only* a combination of private and public information had an effect on energy use (a 20 percent reduction).

. . .

Effect persists after the end of the treatment

::: notes

Authors talk about intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation

Discussion about self selection:
- students were volunteer: self-selection issue (significantly more altruistic and environmental-friendly)
- should bias the response to private information but we

## Moral pleas / moral suasion

![](assets/morality.jpg)

Some social behavior, does not require any direct comparison.

Moral suasion / moral pleas are used to nudge behavior.

Effects seem uncertain and do not last

## {background-color="palegreen"}

[Ito, Ida, and Tanaka (2018)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20160093)

Send message to consumers: *Substantial energy conservation will be required for the society during critical peak-demand hours in summer and winter.*

Compare with economic incentives (dynamic pricing)

. . .
  

Outcome:

- electricity use down by 8% for moral suasion, 16% for economic incentives
- for moral suasion, consumption back to normal after end of messages (dishabituation)
- for economic incentives, green behaviour persists for longer

## Commitment and Goal Setting

Several strands of behavioural economics postulate the existence of several selves (with different goals/preferences) and discuss some kind of __self control__.

The time inconsistency between today's self and tomorrow's self leads to __commitment__ issues

The inconsistency between one's  <span style="color:green">self-image</span> and actual <span style="color:brown">behaviour</span> leads to __cognitive dissonance__.

Northern Illinois goal-setting program, aimed at reducing residential electricity consumption:

- voluntary goal-setting
- provides informaton on how to achieve goal and constant feedback

Results:

- attractive to present-biased consumers
- average savings: 4.4% (8% at the begining)
- higher savings when goal is realistic rather than over-ambitious or very low

Another field experiment with electricity customers:

- voluntary goal-setting...
- with a default option

. . . 

Results:

- defaults can raise goals and realized savings...
- ... but lead to lower savings if set too far from self-set goals

## Results

*Nudging as an Environmental Policy Instrument* by Carlsson, Gravert,  Johansson-
Stenman, and Kurz, 2019,  reviews many studies:

::: {.incremental}

- Many on electricity usage
- Most (serious) studies are on moral nudges:
  - specifically: comparison with a reference group
- Many studies on default nudges
- Results are very context dependent

# Conclusion

## 

::: columns

:::: {.column width=80%}

Ultimately, well-functioning government and market, are supposed to reflect people preferences.

::::

:::: {.column width=20%}

![](assets/invisible_hand.webp)

::::

:::

. . .

Traditional economists do not mess up with preferences:

- They solve market failures

. . .

But some market failures are just unsolvable (like the [tragedy of the horizon](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2015/breaking-the-tragedy-of-the-horizon-climate-change-and-financial-stability))


## 

Should policy makers change people preferences?

. . . 

💦 Mattauch, Stern[^stern] and Konc (2022) [The economics of climate change with endogenous preferences](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/climate-economics-preferences-can-and-should-be-treated-endogenous)

- net-zero requires a change in values
- social dynamics and endogenous preferences must be part of ecological transition models

. . .

Very far from a consensual position. Would you want the CB or the Gvt choose preferences for you?

[^stern]: Stern was famous for The Economics of Climate Change: The Stern Review (2006) and the $\beta$ controversy with Nordhaus.


## Preferences are strange objects.

The economics of well-being show that people are very resilient:

- many studies show that self-reported happiness is mean reverting

A new topic in behavioural science: __motivated beliefs__

- people manipulate their own beliefs
- the truth is inconvenient -> manipulate your truth

##

![](assets/ft.png)



## Acceptability

So what are the options for the change?

- government?
- market?
- society?

Whether or not government and markets reflect well people's preferences, for efficient measures to be accepted, preferences need to change.


## My two cents

<mark>I believe that</mark>, individually, people will ultimately adjust their beliefs and preferences to make the ecological transition less painful.

. . .

Which will increase social acceptance of government measures and market reforms.

. . .

Can nudging be an efficient tool to steer motivated beliefs in the right direction?

. . .

❓ Any data?
