# Multiple Choice Questions: Economics of AI

## Question 1: The Economic Definition of AI
In the "Prediction Machines" framework (Agrawal et al.), how is the current wave of AI best described economically?
A. A new form of sentient intelligence.
B. A technological shock that drastically lowers the cost of prediction.
C. A capital asset that depreciates faster than machinery.
D. A substitute for all human judgment.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** AI makes prediction cheap; this shifts value to complements like data, judgment, and action.

## Question 2: The Nature of Data
Economists consider Data to be a "Non-Rival" good. What does this imply?
A. It is impossible to prevent others from accessing it (it is non-excludable).
B. One person's usage of the data does not reduce its availability to others.
C. Data markets are always perfectly competitive.
D. Data has no value unless it is shared.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Non-rivalry means consumption doesn't deplete the good (unlike an apple). This property often leads to increasing returns to scale.

## Question 3: Tasks and Labor
When AI automates a specific task within your job (e.g., an LLM drafting a standard email), what determines if your wage rises or falls?
A. Whether the AI is "smart" enough to pass the Turing test.
B. Whether the task is dirty or dangerous.
C. Whether the remaining tasks you perform are complements (become more valuable) or solely substitutes.
D. Wages always fall when any part of a job is automated.

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** If the AI makes you more productive at the remaining tasks (complementarity), your value likely rises. If it replaces your main contribution (substitution), it falls.

## Question 4: Generative AI Shifts
How does Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Midjourney) primarily differ from earlier waves of automation?
A. It requires less data to train.
B. It primarily targets "blue-collar" physical tasks.
C. It exposes "creative" and "cognitive" non-routine tasks to potential automation.
D. It cannot make mistakes (hallucinate).

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Previous automation targeted routine manual or cognitive tasks. GenAI unlocks the automation of non-routine cognitive tasks (writing, coding, image generation).

## Question 5: The "Productivity Paradox"
What is "So-So Automation" (Acemoglu & Restrepo)?
A. Technology that is broken half the time.
B. Automation that replaces workers but creates very little productivity gain to offset the labor displacement.
C. AI that is regulated by the government to be less efficient.
D. Automation that increases wages for everyone equally.

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** So-So automation is dangerous because it lowers demand for labor without generating the "productivity dividend" that usually lowers prices and creates new demand/jobs.
