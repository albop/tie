## How do *you* see the *future* of AI ?

. . .

![Blade Runner (1982) still](Blade-Runner.jpg)

. . .

- Science Fiction has explored many issues associated with AI.
  - what happens to individuals, markets, firms, government?
  - who wins, who loses?
- Very often economic future is bleak... 
- Why is that so? 


<!-- ## Stop & think (2 minutes)

Pick one AI application you use (or fear). In pairs:

::: {.incremental}

- What does it *predict*?
- What does it *not* predict (preferences/values/judgment)?
- Who benefits immediately (consumer, worker, firm, state)?

::: -->


# What is AI?

## A simple definition (enough for this course)

AI is a set of methods that learns from data to produce useful outputs (predictions, classifications, text/images, actions).

::: {.incremental}

- Key idea: it improves with experience/training, not just explicit rules
- We do *not* need AI to “think like a human” for it to matter economically

:::

## Why it is hard to say what AI will *never* do

Two recurring facts:

::: {.incremental}

- The frontier moves: tasks once seen as “uniquely human” become routine (translation, chess, image recognition, writing)
- Our labels move too: once a task is solved reliably, we stop calling it “AI”
  - (Tesler’s theorem / “AI is whatever hasn’t been done yet”)

:::

. . .

So claims like “AI will never do X” usually age badly.


## What we can be more confident about

Even if we cannot bound capabilities, we *can* analyze economic mechanisms:

::: {.incremental}

- which tasks become cheaper (prediction, drafting, search, monitoring)
- which inputs become valuable (data, compute, human attention)
- who captures rents (owners of complements and bottlenecks)

:::
  

<!-- ## AI effect

- people have a way to discount achievments of AI as "not AI"
  - because not impressive enough
  - because humans do it in "a different way"
- Larry Tesler theorem: "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet"
- Nick Bostrom: "once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore"
- keep human special
  - interestingly that didn't seem to be a concern before the 70s

# The Classical View

## "This Time it's Different" or "Same old, same old..."?  


![David Ricardo](Ricardo.jpg){width=33%}
![Adam Smith](smith.webp){width=33%}

. . . 

Do you remember the neoclassical production function?

  
##  The (neo)classical production function

What are its main properties?

- production takes several __factors__ as inputs
  - capital
  - labour
  - ... (natural resources, land, ...)
- each factor has a __market price__
- marginal returns w.r.t. each factor are __decreasing__
- factors are paid according to their __marginal productivity__
- the __technology__ is the particular process through which inputs are combined


##  AI and the (neo)classical production function

![Production function with AI shift (illustration)](production_function/pf_1.png)


- the precise description depends on the problem under consideration
- what could you change to take into account the effect of AI?
  - data, technological change ? 


## Three hypotheses about the economic nature of AI

- A technological change
- A new kind of factor: Data
- Yet another kind of factor: Robots
- Something else Completely


# AI is a change in the cost structure

Ajy Agrawal, Joshua Gans and Avi Goldfarb: *Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence* 2018


## Prediction Machines

![](regression.svg)

- many production tasks can be formulated as __prediction problems__
- examples:
  - regression, classification: predict Y as a function of X
  - student -> pass or fail ?
  - should I invest in A or B ?
  - even chatbot: what is the appropriate continuation for an ongoing conversation?

<!-- 
## Stop & think (tasks)

Choose one job you know well (yours, parents, friends). List 5 tasks it contains.

::: {.incremental}

- Which tasks are *substitutes* for cheap prediction?
- Which tasks are *complements* (they become more valuable when prediction is cheaper)?
- What happens to the job if only 2/5 tasks are automated?

::: -->


## Will I lose my job ?
 
- AI is a decrease in the __cost__ of predictions
- The demand for all prediction-intensive tasks will rise (__law of demand__)
- The salary of workers with prediction-intensive tasks will rise (__market price__)
- Value of other tasks will fall (__general equilibrium effect__)
- More precisely:
  - demand for tasks that are __substitute__ to predictions will be low
  - demand for tasks that are __complement__ to predictions will be high


## A simple tasks-model framing (why employment effects are ambiguous)

::: {.incremental}

- Jobs are bundles of tasks; AI rarely replaces *entire* occupations at once
- If AI substitutes for tasks you do, your marginal product may fall
- If AI complements tasks you do (e.g., better targeting, better diagnostics), your marginal product may rise
- Aggregate employment depends on substitution, new tasks/products, demand expansion, and reallocation frictions
- Distributional effects (who owns the complements/data/capital) are usually first-order

# AI is Data


![Data added to the production function (illustration)](production_function/pf_3.png)

Chad Jones and Christopher Tonetti (Stanford) *Nonrivalry and the Economics of Data* (Sep 2020, American Economic Review)


## Data is a factor not a technology

- Data is a __factor__, not a __technology__
  - Can you explain it ?
- The difference between an idea and a factor? Examples:
  - idea: use machine learning to build self driving cars
  - factor: each car-maker gathering his own data to train cars
- Data (even anonymous) improves quality of existing products


## What kind of good is data ?


::: {.incremental}

- Remember the __classification of goods__? 
  - __nonrival__: can be used with leftovers
  - __excludable__: use can be limited to paying customers
  - data is a: __club good__

-  Nonrivality implies
  - <b>increasing returns to scale</b>
    - 🤔: check why
  - marginal value of new data increases more than proportionally

:::


## AI: adds data to the production function (consequences)


::: {.incremental}

- increasing returns to scale implies <b>natural monopoly</b>
  - ->GAFAMs
  - increasing suboptimal __monopoly rents__ (already a problem before existence of AI...)
  - should you regulate a monopoly?
    - it depends what is the barrier to entry: data-gathering or data-processing (cloud)
- other relevant questions
  - where are the markets? (empirically seems to be "undertraded")
  - who owns the data ? Consumer, producer.

:::


## How do you regulate a Data-monopoly ?

::: {.incremental}

- solutions:
  - split the monopolies (if deadweight loss is too big)
  - outlaw data gathering (big productivity loss)
  - force data-sharing: make it a public good
  - let the consumer be free to decide whether to rent their data (remove externalities)

:::
<!-- 
## A quick policy 2×2 (what is the bottleneck?)

Barrier to entry for AI-intensive markets:

::: {.incremental}

- **Data access is the bottleneck** → interoperability, portability, data trusts, targeted sharing mandates
- **Compute/cloud scale is the bottleneck** → cloud competition, procurement, switching costs, access to chips/compute
- If both matter: expect strong increasing returns and durable market power

::: -->

# AI: competition between humans and robots 

![Robots substituting for labour in production (illustration)](production_function/pf_4.png)


## Economic singularity

::: {.incremental}

- In the very long run, could technology be _bad_?
- Recall the neoclassical world
  - market economy
  - technological progress reduces production cost
  - always good for consumers. Increase (real) total income.
  - becomes an inequality problem
- But
  - whether technology reduces salaries depends on whether growth is __labour augmenting__ or __capital augmenting__
  - if AI is a close enough substitute for labour, salaries of "humans" as a whole are at risk
  - there is an economic *singularity* when the wage of humans falls below the __subsistence level__

![Joe Stiglitz Korinek](stiglitz.jpg){width=25%}
![Gilles Saint Paul](saint_paul.jpg){width=25%}


- Two sets of authors reach very similar conclusions
  - Anton Korinek and Joseph Stiglitz (left): more complete/technical
  - Gilles Saint Paul (right): more __political economy__

## Some very long run scenarios

::: {.incremental}

- Analysis taken from Gilles Saint Paul
- *Main hypothesis*: all humans can be replaced by more productive robots
- __Comparative advantage__ logic:
  - humans specialize in work where their comparative disadvantage is lowest (services, art, crafting...)

:::

## Scenario 1: society redistributes income from robots

Four political subscenarios:

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column}

\ 

__Welfare state__

- robot-owners are taxed, income is redistributed
- for instance as universal income
- some productivity losses
- what about international competitiveness?

\ 
__Rentiers society__

- robot owners invest the rent over many generations
- capital concentration increases

::::
:::: {.column}

\ \ \ 

__Neo-Fordism__

- firms pay huge salaries for essentially useless jobs (powerpoint presentations, 😉 ...)
- useful to sustain demand

\ 

__New roman empire__

- robot owners: *patricians* (top 2%)
- rest of population: *plebeians*
  - survive thanks to clientelism
- robots: slaves

::::
:::

## Scenario 2: wars, starvation, epidemic


::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width=30%}
::::: {.incremental}

\ \ 

- human income (marginal productivity) falls below subsistance levels
- malthusian effect: population growth decreases
- not unheard of (Leontief): consider population of draft horses

:::::
::::
:::: {.column width=70%}

![](horses_population.png){.fragment}

::::
:::

## Scenario 3: the Matrix

![](matrix.jpg){width=60%}

- human wage decrease
- subsistence level *decreases* dramatically too


<!---- Carbon emissions decreased by 26% during CoVid ---->

# Something Else Completely?

- Right now AI is a technology (or a factor)
- What if it becomes another intelligent agent?
  - has its own goals
  - its own preferences
  - with superhuman thinking abilities...
- Response in the literature (if curious):
  - Anton Korinek: *if* market economy survives
    - malthusian and non-malthusian scenarios
  - At that stage humans might be something different completely
    - transhumanism

## Conclusion 

- Research on AI is very speculative: especially about the long run
- But concepts from classical economics still help
- Very important assumption: "*if* market economy survives"
- For next time:
  - make sure you understand all concepts in bold


<!-- ## Takeaways (one-slide summary)

::: {.incremental}

- Short run: AI often looks like a big drop in the cost of prediction
- Medium run: data nonrivalry can create increasing returns → market power
- Labour market: focus on tasks (substitutes vs complements), not “jobs disappear” headlines
- Long run: scenarios depend as much on institutions/politics as on technology
