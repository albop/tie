# How to think about the technological frontier?

# What do we learn from past episodes of technological change?

# How do we measure the impact of AI?

# What are the effects on society?



What is a job?
- cf O*NET database

Job complementarity

AI preparedness





# Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work


## Excec Summary

- industrial revolution: productivity shock, replace some workers, complement others

- 40% of employment at risk
  - more in advanced countries than emerging than developing (60/40/26)
  - but advanced countries more ready 

- effect on income / wealth inequality
  - whole population is affected by ai risk
  - but high income more likely to be positive complement
  - model simulation-> beneficial to top earners

- positive effect on income for all woekers

- college-educated workers more prepared to move from jobs

- AI preparedness index
  - advanced: invest in AI innovation and rgulation
  - less developped: infrastructure and digital traning
  - all social safety nets


## AI Exposure and Complementarity


O*NET:
- job
- occupation
- ability

(what is importance?, prevalence?)

(example with a graph)

(problem: O*NET is only for the US)

Labor Market Exposure to AI: Cross-country Differences  and Distributional Implicationss


Countries: UK/US + Brazil, Columbia, India, South Africa

Go beyond tasks by adding social and physical context


Subjectivity of social point of view.


Given the high degree
of uncertainty over the future of this fast-pacing and broadly applicable technology, the
concept of exposure is purposely framed as agnostic on the likelihood of AI complementing
or replacing labor in the performance of a given task or occupation.


Idea: provide specific tables /graphs to students


Data: ILO for all countries
microdata for some



__Problem__: concept of complementarity, not the same


Occupational transitions:

- concept of social mobility
- markov chain

What prevents transition?

cf paper

Why are older workers less willing to switch?
(many reality checks in the paper).



* Who is mostly helped with AI?*

- young college-educated
On the other hand, AI may enable young college-educated workers to become experienced more
quickly as they leverage their familiarity with new technologies to enhance their productivity. With the
introduction of generative AI, the use of AI has itself become much easier. A recent study shows that the
productivity impact of an AI-based conversational assistant was greatest for less experienced and low-skilled
customer support workers; the effect on experienced and highly skilled workers was minimal (Brynjolfsson,
Danielle, and Raymond 2023).

Same with Code Assistant
