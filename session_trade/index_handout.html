<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-mercantilists">The Mercantilists</h2>
<p>Before Smith, the <strong>Mercantilists</strong> (16th-17th century):</p>
<ul>
<li>International trade is a way to increase the inflow of precious metals into the Kingdom (UK).</li>
<li>Underlying objective: accumulation of gold, wealth.
<ul>
<li>Reflects the power of a country.</li>
<li>A country must export more than it imports.</li>

<section id="absolute-advantage" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="absolute-advantage">Absolute Advantage</h2>
<p><img src="assets/smith.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Adam Smith (1723-1790): Scottish.</p>
<p>One of the founding fathers of classical economics. His question: “Why do countries engage in international trade?”</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider two countries each producing two goods. Each country is characterized by its own productivity for the production of each good.</li>
<li>A country has an absolute advantage in the production of a good if it can produce that good at a lower cost than another country. Therefore, trade is profitable and each country specializes in the production of the good for which it has an <em>absolute advantage</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>. . .</p>
<p><strong>Limitation</strong>: In this theoretical framework, a country whose production costs are higher than those of all its partners cannot export profitably.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>This theory does not explain why a country that is more efficient in the production of all goods would still benefit from maintaining trade relations with its neighboring countries.</p>

<section id="the-ricardian-model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-ricardian-model">The Ricardian Model</h2>
<p>David Ricardo (1772-1823)</p>
<p>A country can benefit from specialization by producing the goods for which it has a comparative advantage, even if it has an absolute disadvantage in all the goods it produces (unlike Smith).</p>
<p><strong>Assumption</strong>: labor is the only factor of production and is mobile within the country but immobile internationally</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>To show that trade is always preferable, he imagines that Portugal has an absolute advantage over England for two goods, which, according to Adam Smith’s theory, would prevent trade from occurring.</p>

<p>In which good should England specialize in? (compare productivity ratios for both countriess)</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<ul>
<li><em>solution</em>: portugal specializes in wine and england in cloth <!-- 
What 


To determine what England should specialize in, let's compare its productivity for each product with that of Portugal:
Ratio of English wine productivity to Portuguese wine productivity: (1/120) / (1/80) = 0.66
Ratio of English cloth productivity to Portuguese cloth productivity: (1/100) / (1/90) = 0.9
England's disadvantage is smaller for cloth than for wine, as its relative productivity is better (0.9 compared to 0.66 for wine).


Ratio of Portuguese wine productivity to English wine productivity: (1/80) / (1/120) = 1.5

Ratio of Portuguese cloth productivity to English cloth productivity: (1/90) / (1/100) = 1.11

Portugal therefore has a comparative advantage in wine (productivity of 1.5 compared to 1.11 for cloth).

Before free trade, producing 2m of cloth required 190 hours of work (100+90), and 200 hours of work for 2L of wine (120+80).

Given their comparative advantages, Portugal specializes in wine and England in cloth.

To produce the 2m of cloth, England will take 200 hours, saving 20 hours compared to the previous situation (see Table). It can now devote these 20 additional hours to producing more cloth, for example.

Portugal, abandoning cloth production, will take 160 hours to produce the 2L of wine, thus saving 10 hours of work. In total, 30 hours of work are saved (or used to produce more goods). Both countries benefit from specialization and free trade.

Thus, by reasoning on comparative costs and not absolute costs, he demonstrates (in his theoretical framework) that it is advantageous for each to specialize in the production for which they have the strongest advantage (Portuguese wine), or the smallest disadvantage (English cloth).
The Ricardian theory of comparative advantage links international trade to differences in production technology between countries (represented by the number of labor units needed to produce a good in a given sector). --></li>
</ul>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>The Ricardo model has two fundamental conclusions: <em>all countries can benefit from (the option) to trade</em>, which allows for more efficient production.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>In a trade situation, countries will specialize in the production of the good where they have a <strong>comparative advantage</strong> (higher productivity ratio).</p>

<p>First published in a more literary form by Bertil Ohlin, who attributed the co-authorship of the model to his thesis advisor, Eli Heckscher, in 1933.</p>
<p>In 1941, Paul Samuelson and Wolfgang Stolper deduced an important theorem on factor remuneration, which was systematically incorporated into the presentation of the model, now known by the acronym <strong>HOS</strong>.</p>
<p>In this model, international trade is based on <strong>differences in factor endowments</strong> (labor, capital, resources, etc.). It thus highlights that differences in productivity between countries (i.e., Ricardo) are not the only explanation for comparative advantages.</p>

<li>Partial <em>specialization of each country in the good that is relatively the most intensive in the factor with which the country is relatively best endowed</em> (<strong>better factor endowment</strong>).</li>

## Gravity and International Trade

This law of gravitation is also used in economics. The gravity model establishes an empirical relationship (Walter Isard, 1954; Jan Tinbergen, 1962) that explains the value of trade between two countries and sheds light on the determinants and obstacles to trade.

Main determinants:

- The size of the countries,
- Differences in factor endowments and technology,
- Geographic characteristics matter a lot (CEPII's distance database): Distance, but also the existence of a common border, or even cultural distance (language, colony...),
- Other trade barriers (trade policies, time, risks...). -->
<!-- 
## Empirical Relationship Supported by Theoretical Justifications:

Ultimately, all trade models predict gravity-type trade, and the role that the size of economies plays in their external trade is well understood.
For example, Krugman's model (1980) shows how the volume of trade a country has with the rest of the world is proportional to its size and negatively affected by trade barriers.
Due to increasing returns and transportation costs, firms are incentivized to concentrate their production as close as possible to their market.

Since consumers have a taste for variety, each country has an interest in specializing in a given variety of a good (to benefit from economies of scale) and importing other varieties (to increase the population's welfare), so relatively similar countries still have an interest in trading.
However, while the importance of distance for trade is empirically verified, it has been difficult to justify theoretically. Several authors have proposed explanations, but these rely on factors (e.g., transportation techniques, tariffs, the nature of traded goods, etc.) that have undergone profound changes over the decades, so none of them truly explain the stability of the distance exponent γ.

## Gravity and International Trade

Chaney (2013): seeks to explain why this exponent is stable over time with the modeling of vertical production chains.
Firms combine capital and labor with intermediate goods supplied by upstream firms.
They have two ways to circumvent obstacles related to international trade.
Either they pay a direct cost to create a contact abroad,
Or they communicate with their existing contacts and seek to learn more about their own customers, which involves direct interaction and an indirect cost.
If technological progress affects the first cost and perhaps even the frequency of interactions by facilitating travel and communication, it does not reduce the need for direct interaction. The distribution of a firm's exports in space then depends on how distance influences the direct cost associated with creating contacts.

## Gravity and International Trade

The geographic distribution of a firm's suppliers and customers will evolve over time:
As a firm acquires more and more suppliers and customers, the suppliers and customers tend to be, on average, increasingly distant.
Thus, the largest firms import and export over increasingly long average distances.
The impact of distance on international trade will then depend on the distribution of firm sizes:
Since large firms trade over long distances, the volume of trade a country conducts with a distant region will ultimately depend on the number of large firms present in its territory.
In particular, if the distribution of firm sizes is close to Zipf's law (the second-largest firm is half the size of the largest, the third-largest firm is one-third the size of the largest, etc.), then Chaney's model shows that the volume of trade flows is inversely proportional to geographic distance.

## Gravity: Extension

By placing geography at the heart of the analysis, the gravity model has been applied to many other "variables" and generally gives convincing empirical results on:

Mainly goods, but also services!
Migrations
Financial flows
Direct investments
...

## Example: US

The Border Effect

Even when there is no tariff between two neighboring countries, trade between provinces of a country will be higher than cross-border trade.

Example of the Canada/US border:
Both countries are members of NAFTA (formerly USCAN); most Canadians speak English; and individuals can cross the border freely without too many formalities.
And yet, trade data between Canadian provinces among themselves and with neighboring US states show that, ceteris paribus, there is more trade between Canadian provinces than between Canadian provinces and US states.

## Why a Border Effect?

Tariffs (not US/Canada) and Non-Tariff Measures.

Domestic bias, especially in public markets.

Institutional and legal differences can make contracting difficult.

Different currencies.

## Border Effect as a Measure of Integration

The EU is supposed to be an integrated market.
In a standard gravity equation, the EU market will be compared to the rest of the world to verify and demonstrate that it is indeed more integrated.
However, one can adopt the opposite approach: compare the EU market to the most integrated markets, i.e., domestic markets.
If the EU market is indeed perfectly integrated, the borders within the EU should have no impact (on trade). -->

<p>The Grossman and Helpman model is a <strong>common agency model</strong> (one agent, several principals) with a <em>two-stage game</em>.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>The basic analytical framework is that of a model with several production sectors with specific factors. Each sector produces a particular good with labor and a factor of production specific to the sector.</p>

<p>The vector of trade policy determines a tariff (positive or negative) on imports in each sector.</p>

</section>
<section id="protection-for-sale-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="protection-for-sale-1">Protection For Sale</h2>
<p>In the first stage, pressure groups define their contribution functions.</p>

<p>In the second stage, the incumbent government chooses its political position taking into account the contribution functions defined by the pressure groups.</p>

<section id="protection-for-sale-2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="protection-for-sale-2">Protection For Sale</h2>
<p>Formally, the government seeks to maximize an “objective” function that is a weighted average of contributions and general welfare, with the goal of rewarding interest groups and being re-elected in the next election.</p>
<p>Candidates must therefore balance policies that favor particular interest groups with those that align with the general interest.</p>
<p>The equilibrium of this game is characterized by:</p>

<li>A vector of contribution functions (one for each pressure group) such that each contribution function maximizes the welfare of the members of the respective pressure group, given the contribution functions defined by other pressure groups and the anticipated decision rule of the government;</li>

<li>interest groups pressure the government for high selling prices in their own production sectors and low prices in other sectors, as they are also consumers of goods produced by other sectors.</li>

## Production Subsidy

![](assets/subvention_production.png)
![](assets/taxe_consommation.png) -->
<!-- 
## Production Subsidy & Consumption Tax

If we overlay the two graphs and study the imposition of both instruments (production subsidy and consumption tax), we have the same effects as an import tariff: B + D
decrease in consumer surplus,
increase in producer surplus,
growth in public revenues (revenue from the consumption tax > cost of the production subsidy).
Normal: import tariff = consumption tax + production subsidy. -->
<!-- 
## Quantitative Restrictions: Quotas

The State can also *limit the purchase of foreign products* by setting maximum quantities (or maximum values) for imports. This is called a __quota__ or __contingent__.

Quotas are defined by the State based on the physical quantity of imports or exports. They can be established unilaterally by a State or negotiated with importing or exporting countries that "voluntarily" agree to restrict their imports or exports.

If the imported quantity results from an agreement between the importing country and the exporting country, it is called an orderly marketing agreement (OMA) or "voluntary" export restraint (VER).

The 1970s-80s were characterized by an unprecedented development of such agreements.

## Quantitative Restrictions: Quotas

States generally implement quota systems through __licenses__.

These are *property titles* granting their holder the right to import or export a certain quantity of a given good:

- Sales of licenses or auctions to interested importers and exporters
- Issuing them for free based on administrative criteria.

Example:

- The United States has implemented an import quota for foreign cheeses.
- Only certain companies are then allowed to import cheese, each having the right (license) to import only a certain quantity per year.
- Each individual quota is set based on the quantities of cheese imported by the company in the past.

## Quantitative Restrictions: Quotas

Impact of an import quota:

- Same effect as a tariff if licenses are granted efficiently.

Otherwise:

- Decrease in consumer surplus,
- Increase in producer surplus,
- Nothing for public revenues,
- Rent for foreign companies,

Net cost for society, potentially higher than the tariff.

<!-- ## Price Volatility and Protection

Price volatility is a characteristic of agricultural markets.

This volatility is harmful to both producers and consumers.

Different ways to reduce volatility:

- Reduce or stabilize production levels (uprooting, slaughter premiums, land freezing, storage, processing premiums…)
- Isolate the domestic market from international market price fluctuations (variable levies, entry prices…)

## 

![](assets/volat_prix.png)

![](assets/volat_prix_2.png) -->
<!-- ## Assessment of Import Tariff Protection

Primarily protect domestic producers (in a simplified framework with a homogeneous good, perfect competition, partial equilibrium…). These tools allow for the maintenance of high prices (potentially to the detriment of consumers and/or the government).

Another strategic tool: Anti-dumping and countervailing duties (Same as a tariff, but applied in certain circumstances, possibly in addition to existing tariffs).

## Export Subsidies

An export subsidy is a payment made to an individual or company that ships goods abroad.
Like tariffs and export taxes, these subsidies can be specific or ad valorem.
They encourage producers and traders to export by making their foreign sales more profitable, which has the effect of raising the price of this product on the domestic market.
When a state subsidizes the export of a product, traders will tend to export this product until the domestic price is higher than the sum of the export price and the subsidy. Export subsidies therefore favor producers of export goods and traders, to the detriment of domestic consumers and taxpayers.
Subsidies are prohibited under the WTO (2015), especially in agriculture. -->
<!-- 

## Export Restrictions: Export Taxes

Export taxes help reduce the price of export products paid to the producer and decrease the selling price of these products on the domestic market. They tend to discourage domestic production while encouraging domestic consumption of exported products, thus ultimately reducing export quantities.

Export taxes therefore benefit domestic consumers and public finances at the expense of producers. If the goal is national food security, this measure can be effective.

Recent example (Argentina):

- Decree 793, published on September 4, 2018, establishes an export tax for all customs nomenclatures.
- It imposes a 12% tax on the FOB value of goods, with a cap equivalent to 4 Argentine pesos (ARS) per USD, on all products exported from Argentina.
- This measure is temporary, it took effect on January 1, 2019, andwas suspended at the end of 2020. The country being in a severe financial and economic crisis, this decree aims to restore budget balance. -->
<!-- 
## Discriminatory VAT Reimbursement in China: Export Tax

Principle: China implemented a VAT in 1994 but does not always fully reimburse exporters: incentive to sell on the domestic market!

Average reimbursement level varies greatly: likely used as a mechanism to influence exports.

Rates vary depending on stated objectives: environment, upgrading, food price stability, and hidden (subsidizing downstream industries, keeping rare earths).

## Average VAT Reimbursement

![](assets/remboursement_variable.png)

## Average VAT Reimbursement

![](assets/remboursement_variable_2.png)

## And It Works

Effective system with a certain impact on exports:
An increase of one percentage point in the rebate (e.g., from 11% VAT to 12%) is associated with a 7% increase in export quantities.

Similarly, a one percentage point decrease in the rate reduces exports by 7%.

Certainly helped maintain Chinese exports during the financial crisis period while global prices declined. -->

<p>The effect of NTMs on trade can be the primary objective of the implemented policy (e.g., quotas or import bans), or it can be a consequence of another policy objective (e.g., product quality control or packaging requirements).</p>
</section>
<section id="non-tariff-measures-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="non-tariff-measures-1">Non-Tariff Measures</h2>
<p>According to WTO agreements, the <em>use of NTMs is allowed under certain circumstances</em>. They include, among others, the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) or the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS), both negotiated during the Uruguay Round.</p>
<p>These agreements allow governments to implement policies with a legitimate objective even if they may increase trade costs.</p>
<p>However, <em>NTMs are sometimes used as a means to circumvent free trade rules</em> and protect domestic industries at the expense of foreign competition. In this case, NTMs are called non-tariff barriers (NTBs).</p>
<p>It is very difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish legitimate NTMs from protectionist NTMs, especially since the same measure can be employed for different reasons.</p>
</section>
<section id="non-tariff-measures-2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="non-tariff-measures-2">Non-Tariff Measures</h2>
<p>To facilitate the collection and dissemination of information on NTMs in force in each country, a classification system for NTMs was developed in 2008 by a group of experts from 8 international organizations - FAO, IMF, ITC, OECD, UNCTAD, UNIDO, World Bank, and WTO - and revised in 2009 and 2012.</p>
<p>This classification has a total of 16 chapters ranging from letter A to letter P. It distinguishes between import measures (Chapters A to O) imposed by the importing country and export measures (Chapter P) applied by the exporting country itself. Import measures are then categorized into two main groups, technical measures and non-technical measures.</p>

<!-- ## Effective Protection

Corden: if a sector uses intermediate goods that are more protected than its own production, the overall tariff policy discourages this production because it increases the cost and/or reduces the availability of intermediate goods.

Conversely, when all inputs are less protected than the output, the sector receives, in fact, stronger protection than indicated by the declared rate.

This incentive (or disincentive) to produce in a sector is measured by the change in added value caused by the overall tariff structure.
This indicator is known as the effective protection rate.

## Effective Protection

Simple case:
Consider two countries A and B, each buying 80 worth of intermediate consumptions.
In B, assembly costs 20, so the finished product is put on the international market at a price of 80 + 20 = 100.
A also wants to produce this product but protects its assembly activity with a 10% import duty on the finished product.
So A can afford costs of (100 x 1.1) – 80 = 30, thus 50% higher costs than in B thanks to a nominal 10% import duty on finished products.
The effective protection is 50%.

## Effective Protection Rate in 2009

Higher EPR if the MFN tariff on the finished product is higher and if national production depends on imported inputs (less protection on inputs). -->

The WTO: Assessment and Challenges

## Historical Context Pre-WWII

- 19th century: period of relative free trade

  - Anticorn laws, Franco-English commercial treaties, colonies, unilateral liberalization...

- Late 19th - early 20th century: first wave of protectionism
  - Méline Laws 1892
  - Implementation of higher tariffs, quotas, embargo...

- Between the two wars, Great Depression

  - Highly protectionist policies
  - Safeguarding of Industries Act 1921 in Britain
  - Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act US 1930
  - Exacerbates the crisis, 40% reduction in American imports, repercussions on international relations...

## The GATT Rounds

## Comments: The GATT Rounds

From 1947 to 1967: negotiations mainly focused on tariffs.

- Increasing number of goods.
- By the end of the Kennedy Round, the average global protection rate was 10 times lower than in 1947.
- But the reductions mainly concerned developed countries and industrial goods.

According to Deardoff and Stern (1983): the average rate after the end of the round was 6.5% for the USA, 4% for Japan, 8% for France, and 9% for Germany.

## Comments: The GATT Rounds

Late 1970s: turbulence in the global economy:

- 1973 oil shock, abandonment of fixed exchange rates...

However, Tokyo Round:

- Tariff reductions
- Regulation of subsidies
- Allows anti-dumping and countervailing measures

Average tariff (weighted by imports) reduced by a third, especially for industrial products.

## Comments: The GATT Rounds

Uruguay Round (last GATT negotiation round) begins in 1986:

- Numerous conflicts in the 1980s (EU, USA...).
- Climate of trade tensions.
- GATT reached its limits and could not resolve trade disputes (no established schedule, easy blockage, lengthy processes, and no resolutions...).
- 120 participants – 26,000 pages of legal texts and commitments.

Marrakech Agreement, 1994: Creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO).

## The GATT Assessment

Tariff reduction and consolidation

- A "club of the rich" that works well: strong trade liberalization
- Little concern for the interests of developing countries: agriculture and textiles not covered
- But a ripple effect (growth in the number of members, extension of scope)
- Ineffective dispute resolution mechanism
From periodic agreement to permanent institution: Creation of the WTO.

## The WTO Fact Sheet

Headquarters: Geneva
Created on: January 1, 1995
Number of members: 164 (September 2019)

- States
  - Fully autonomous customs territories
  - European Union
- Observers:
  - States in the process of accession
  - International organizations (IMF...)
- Budget: < 200 million Swiss francs (2018)
- Staff: about 600 people

Leadership: Director-General, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala

## The WTO - Functions

- Administration of WTO trade agreements
- Framework for trade negotiations
- Dispute resolution
- Monitoring of national trade policies
- Technical assistance and training for developing countries
- Cooperation with other international organizations

## The Main Objectives of the WTO

- Promote wealth creation through international trade liberalization, but obstacles:

  - Political economy: liberalization costs concentrated on a few well-organized sectors. Diffuse benefits (consumers) poorly organized politically with low individual interest.
  - Limit the "free-rider" effect
  - Ensure the continuity of the GATT

Grant special concessions and assistance to developing countries

## General Philosophy

A negotiation framework...

  - ... governed by a set of rules...
  - ... to help resolve disputes between states under the aegis of an impartial arbitrator.

Only governments (under influence?) participate in the game

Mercantilism vs. Ricardianism.

## General Principles and Associated Tools

Non-discrimination (clarification of GATT principles)

__Most-Favored-Nation Clause__ ("MFN clause"): any trade advantage granted by one country to another (even if it is not a WTO member) must be immediately extended to all WTO members.

- __National treatment principle__: imported products or services on the territory of a member must not be treated less favorably than domestic products or services.

## General Principles and Associated Tools (2)

- Freer trade: a progressive and negotiated path
  - Reciprocity: Countries exchange concessions on market access, for example, but also changes in regulations on standards (sanitary, technical...) or property rights
- Fair competition
- Transparency and predictability
  - Consolidation: negotiations focus not on applied tariffs but on bound tariffs (ceilings)
  - Notification and information obligations
  - Trade Policy Review Mechanism

## General Principles and Associated Tools (3)

Other negotiation tools:

- Round and associated principle of single undertaking: no à la carte choice, it's all or nothing (exception of plurilateral agreements)

## Main Exceptions to General Principles

- __Regional Trade Agreements__ (RTAs): liberalization of a substantial part of trade, but applied loosely. Article XXIV.

- Safeguard clause, Contingent protection (anti-dumping)

- __Agriculture__ (domestic support and export subsidies)

- Textiles and clothing (multi-fiber agreements)

## Main Exceptions for Developing Countries

- Since the 1960s, but long without a legal framework.

- General framework through the Enabling Clause in 1979 only:
  - Possibility of differentiated and more favorable treatment for developing countries

- Derogation from reciprocity for developing countries

  - Justifications for non-reciprocal preferences granted by developed countries
  - __Lesser obligations__ for agreements between developing countries

## The Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) Review

Over the past 20 years (1995-2015), nearly 500 disputes have been brought before the WTO.
About half were settled through bilateral discussions, and the other half were handled through the panel procedure.

The EU and US use this system a lot.

Most often, (the complaint is justified and) the complainant wins: 88% of cases.

The system relies heavily on legal (and economic) expertise.

## Negotiations in Practice: The Case of Tariffs

In multilateral negotiations, countries consider two types of tariffs (for an importing country that is a WTO member):

Bound tariff (or CTS in English): a ceiling that a country commits not to exceed (except in special cases: anti-dumping, for example). Its tariffs can vary between [0, CTS], but vis-à-vis all its partners.

Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) tariff: the lowest tariff a country commits to applying to its WTO partners.

## WTO Tariffs

Negotiations focus on the bound tariff.

That is, if a country commits to reducing a tariff on a product, the reduced tariff will be the ceiling, not the MFN.

Therefore, only reductions resulting in a bound tariff lower than the currently applied MFN tariff will have an impact on trade.

If the tariff cut does not lower the MFN, it will only reduce the binding margin (difference between CTS and MFN). However, this reduction in the margin can translate into reduced uncertainty for the exporter and thus increase trade. Graphically, the stakes of tariff negotiations are therefore:

## The Doha Round

Launch of the Doha Round in November 2001 (6 years after the creation of the WTO).

Under the sign of development (DDA).

The subject is not unilateral liberalization, but the exchange of concessions and the definition of rules.

Many topics: tariff liberalization, services, trade facilitation, geographical indications, environmental agreements (improving rules), intellectual property...

## Points of Disagreement

Feeling of deadlock, great difficulties in finding common ground, for many reasons:
Differentiated treatment is not appreciated.
Very ambitious: too many members, too many topics: a single agreement seems complex, seeking a "minimal" agreement.
Limited benefits for developing countries that already benefit from many tariff advantages through preferential agreements (risk of preference erosion) and, moreover, commitments that are too costly and binding.
A framework poorly adapted to a multipolar world, there are not only developing and developed countries.
Very low expected gains as the ambition of the round has eroded.
For developed countries, competition from preferential agreements (EU starts negotiations as early as 2004).
The food price crisis (2007-2008), the financial crisis, the Euro crisis, climate issues, etc., have shifted priorities.

## Multilateral Negotiations Today

- Some successes, reduced agenda ("Doha Light" in Bali).
- Bali, December 3-6, 2013
  - The Bali Package: 1st multilateral agreement signed since the creation of the WTO.
  - Trade facilitation: measures aim to reduce bureaucracy at borders.
  - Aid for the development of least developed countries: increased exemption from customs duties for products from least developed countries.
  - Agriculture: renewed commitment to reduce export subsidies.
- Nairobi, December 15-19, 2015
  - Historic decision to eliminate export subsidies for agricultural products.
- Buenos Aires, December 10-13, 2017
  - No agreement was reached.
- Nur-Sultan (Kazakhstan), June 8-11, 2020
  - TODO

## The WTO Review, 25 Years Later

- Significant increase in the number of members (with the largest countries within the WTO = attraction power).
- Strength of the multilateral framework – structured framework for dialogue and negotiation.
- Effectiveness of the DSB, "until recently."
- MFN: the rule has become the exception.
- Difficulty for the poorest countries to be heard.
- "Relatively" democratic functioning (?)

##

![](assets/measures)

## Challenges for the WTO and Its Future

Questioning of the DSB.
Consensus vs. vote.
Failure of the DDA, relative successes of recent ministerial conferences.
Categorization of countries (developing countries...).
Trade war, uncertainty.
Multilateralism and plurilateralism: trade agreements.

## Challenges for the WTO and Its Future

- Two recent particular problems:
  - Level Playing Field: State intervention in the domestic economy (subsidies, competition, state-owned enterprises, and public procurement).
- WTO limitations on this subject, particularly in defining subsidies.

- Forced technology transfer:
  - TRIPS and TRIMS agreements are not enough! -->

## Short-Term Impacts on Costs and Prices

In the short term, trade tensions create uncertainties detrimental to investor confidence.
When protection is temporary, it does not justify new investments or new hires.
Protectionism also has consequences on national production incorporated as intermediate inputs in imports:
In the United States, this re-imported national value-added accounts for 18.2% of imports from Mexico, but only 1.2% of those from China.

## Quantitative Evaluations

Various evaluations.

Different methodologies.

Presentation of CEPII conclusions.

## CGE Evaluation

CEPII Letter "The Waterer Watered: Trade War and Global Value Chains," Bellora and Fontagné, April 2019.

Use of a global computable general equilibrium model.

Allows accounting for direct and indirect effects (third countries, unaffected sectors, different markets...).

## CGE Evaluation

Scenario 1:
Activation by the United States of "Section 232" on aluminum and steel (including exemptions, tariff quotas, and retaliation) and "Section 301" on US imports from China (as well as Chinese retaliation).
Scenario 2:
Same as Scenario 1, plus:
Possible US sanctions on automobile and component imports, considered in spring 2019.
The main automobile exporters to the United States retaliate and increase their tariffs on key products they import from the United States by 25 percentage points (excluding energy and pharmaceutical products), up to the value of their targeted automobile exports.
Scenario 3:
Elimination of bilateral tariffs on industrial products between the United States and the EU27 (Brexit), while measures on steel and aluminum against partners other than the EU and those related to Section 301 against China would be maintained. -->
<!-- # What's a Trade War?

1. Infant Industry Argument
Proponents: Alexander Hamilton, Friedrich List
Concept: Emerging industries in developing countries may struggle to compete with well-established foreign competitors. Temporary protection allows these industries to grow, develop economies of scale, and eventually compete on a global level.
Criticism: Industries often become dependent on protection and may not become competitive as intended.

2. Strategic Trade Theory
Proponents: Paul Krugman, James Brander, Barbara Spencer
Concept: In industries with significant economies of scale or network effects (e.g., aerospace, tech), government intervention can help domestic firms gain a competitive advantage.
Example: Boeing vs. Airbus, where both the U.S. and the EU provided subsidies to help their firms compete in a high-stakes global industry.
Criticism: Can lead to retaliatory trade wars and inefficiencies in market allocation.

3. National Security Argument
Concept: Certain industries (e.g., defense, energy, food production, semiconductors) are vital to national security. Relying on foreign suppliers can create vulnerabilities in times of conflict or crisis.
Example: The U.S. imposing restrictions on Chinese telecom firms (Huawei) to prevent foreign influence in critical infrastructure.
Criticism: Often used as a political tool rather than a genuine economic necessity.

4. Terms of Trade Argument (Optimal Tariff Theory)
Proponents: Frank Graham, Harry Johnson
Concept: If a country has significant market power as a large importer of a good, it can impose tariffs to improve its terms of trade (i.e., reduce the price of imports relative to exports). This allows the country to capture a greater share of global surplus.
Example: A country like the U.S. imposing tariffs on Chinese goods could theoretically force China to lower export prices.
Criticism: If trading partners retaliate, the gains may be wiped out, leading to trade wars.

5. Balance of Payments Protectionism
Concept: If a country runs persistent trade deficits, it may impose tariffs or import restrictions to reduce its dependence on foreign capital and stabilize its economy.
Example: Many developing countries impose import restrictions to conserve foreign exchange reserves.
Criticism: Often leads to inefficiencies and consumer price increases.

6. Employment Protection Argument (Keynesian Approach)
Proponents: John Maynard Keynes (to some extent)
Concept: Free trade can cause job losses in certain sectors due to cheaper foreign competition. Protectionist policies can shield domestic workers and industries from economic shocks.
Example: U.S. steel tariffs imposed to protect domestic jobs.
Criticism: Often leads to higher costs for consumers and downstream industries.

7. Cultural & Strategic Autonomy Arguments
Concept: Some countries protect industries such as media, agriculture, or tech to preserve national identity and autonomy from foreign influence.
Example: France's restrictions on foreign media and film imports to preserve French culture.
Criticism: Can lead to inefficiencies and higher costs for consumers. -->
