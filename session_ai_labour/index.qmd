## Research in Big Institutions

The *publication* of research papers in big international institutions has several goals:

::: {.incremental}

- disseminate research
  - usually from researchers that are closest to policy circles

- build a common narrative that countries can build on to negociate with the same language
  - provide a discussion forum when there isn't one

- (usually not) state an official position of the institution

:::

##  Example of Shaping the Narrative

Bank of England, communicates on forward guidance:

- delphic vs odyssean forward guidance

## About the IMF

The IMF is a global organization that works to achieve sustainable growth and prosperity for all of its 190 member countries. It does so by supporting economic policies that promote financial stability and monetary cooperation, which are essential to increase productivity, job creation, and economic well-being. The IMF is governed by and accountable to its member countries.

. . . Then why is it interested in AI?


. . . 

Check out [the webpage](https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/IMF-Lending)


## Why is IMF interested in AI?


::: {.incremental}

1. IMF lends in times of crisis

  - it is useful to know what might cause the next one (CoVid2, AI, food shortage, global warning...)

2. It pushes for structural reforms (but which ones?)

  - so that countries can reimburse loans

3. It sometimes act as a last-resort multilateral institution

  - where do all finance ministers sit down to discuss ...?

# What is it exactly that you do? Can AI do your job?


##

::: {.callout-note icon=false}

## Question 2

Check out the O*NET database.

What is the difference between a skill, an abilty, ...

What part occupational content is more relevant to judge AI exposure?


:::


## 

![](assets/onet.png)

## O*NET

::: {.incremental}

- Conceptual framework: O*NET content model

  - an occupation (a job) is associated to a particular content (skills, abilities, tasks, activities, context)
  - some content relates to the worker, some to the nature of the occupation
  - data comes from incumbant and experts

:::



## How can you measure AI fitness for a job?

Which content is more relevant to judge AI fitness?

- skills
- abilities
- tasks

A growing body of literature (led by Autor , Levy, Murnane 2003) is using content of jobs to assess the potential effect of new technologies.



## Earlier work has focused on tasks

Earlier work has focused on tasks.

- ... for automation
- ... for machine learning

## Example

*What Can Machines Learn and What Does It Mean for Occupations and the Economy?*, 2018 Erik Brynjolfsson, Tom Mitchell, and Daniel Rock

From O*NET database (occupational information)

  - 964 *occupations* ,decomposed 18,156 *tasks*
  - Tasks agggregated into of 2,069 work activities
    - ex: sort information, show empathy

Use human judgment to measure the suitability for machine learning of each task.


## Human Judgment

![](assets/mturk.webp)

. . . 

In practice, human judgment is replaced with Amazon Turk or CrowdFlower



## Example: Result (1)

![ ](assets/result__occupations.png){height=100%}


## Example: Result (2)

![](assets/result__distribution.png){width=100%}


## Examples: Conclusions

Results from from Brynjolfsson et al., 2018:

- Almost no

  - fully replaceable occupation
  - fully ML immune occupation

- All the distribution of income is exposed.

The results are typical from the literature on the future of work.



## Abilities


IMF Paper looks at __abilities__

Paper builds on  *Occupational, industry, and geographic exposure to artificial intelligence: A novel dataset and its potential uses*, by Felten, Raj, and Seamans 2021.

Main idea: try to assess the adequacy of AI for each ability.



## Construct AI suitability index

AI exposure of ability $k$:

$$ AIEO_k = \sum_j L_{kj} AI_j $$

where:

- $L_{kj}$: ability content of task $k$
- $AI_j$: suitability of task $j$ for ability $j$

. . . 

How do we measure AI abilities?


##

![](assets/eff)

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a well-regarded digital rights nonprofit that was founded in 1990,

As one of its activities, the EFF collects and maintains statistics about the progress of AI across separate artificial intelligence applications.


Each AI application has an index corresponding to AI development.

## EFF application definitions {scrollable="true"}

| AI application	   | Definition                                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Abstract strategy games |	The ability to play abstract games involving sometimes complex strategy and reasoning ability, such as chess, go, or checkers, at a high level. |
| Real-time video games |	The ability to play a variety of real-time video games of increasing complexity at a high level. |
| Image recognition |	The determination of what objects are present in a still image. |
| Visual question answering	| The recognition of events, relationships, and context from a still image.
| Image generation |	The creation of complex images |
| Reading comprehension |	The ability to answer simple reasoning questions based on an understanding of text. |
| Language modeling	 | The ability to model, predict, or mimic human language. |
| Translation |	The translation of words or text from one language into another. |
| Speech recognition |	The recognition of spoken language into text. |
| Instrumental track recognition |	The recognition of instrumental musical tracks. |



## Mapping EFF application definitions to ONET abilities

Human Judgment (mturk)  is used to associate each each of the $l\in[1,10]$ EFF application to the $j\in[1,51]$ O*NET categories: $x_{l,j}$


AI suitability for ability $j$ is then defined as $$AI_j = \sum_{l=1}^{10} x_{l,j}$$

Task-substitution == displacement effect (Acemoglu and Restrepo ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AUTOMATION AND WORK)

Counter-balancing effects:
- productivity-effect
- capital accumulation
- deepening of automation

Reinstatement Effect

 -->



<!-- 
##  Past Studies


- Approach
  - decompose occupations in tasks
  - for each task, find a way to evaluate the extent to which it can be replaced by the new technology
  - several appoaches:
    - use human judgement
 -->



<!-- 

- Rise of automation was detrimental middle jobs. Same here?
  - AI technology is potentially very pervasive because it doesn't require much formalism
  - Polanyi's paradox: we know more than we can tell

- Consider technology available today: Machine Learning (including DL)
- Is it susceptible to replace workers ? is your work at risk ?
- Paper considers only displacement feasibility -->
<!-- 

## Who is going to be replaced?

*What Can Machines Learn and What Does It Mean for Occupations and the Economy?* Erik Brynjolfsson, Tom Mitchell, and Daniel Rock

  - AI technology is potentially very pervasive because it doesn't require much formalism

<!-- 
## Can AI do what you do?

Which jobs are AI-susceptible?

We need to associate AI-susceptibility to tasks.

Several approaches:
- human judgement
  - 
- ask AI

## Limits

What are the limits with the task-based approach? -->

## Question 3

How does the SDN distinguishes between jobs that are more or less complement to AI.
What are the contexts ? How is the complementarity score computed?


:::



## Complementarity-augmented AI-exposure


The main contribution from the Pizzilnelli et al. paper : use more content from O*NET:

- work context: physical and social factors that influence the nature of work
- job zones: groups of occupations characterized by similar levels of education, on-the-job training, and professional experience needed to perform the work

Some contexts *shield* workers from being replaced by AI


##

Each O*NET occupation is associated with each of the following context by a 0-100 score:

- Communication
- Responsibility
- Physical Conditions
- Criticality
- Routine
- Skills

. . .

The final complementarity score is the average of all contexts, normalized to be between 0 and 1.

## Exposure / Complementarity

## Comments?




# Who will be affected ? Who will win / loose ?

### Question 4

According to the article who is most likely to be affected?

What would be the effect on inequalities?

Which countries will suffer most?

:::

## Within a Country

![](assets/loosers_winners.png)


## Effect on inequalities

The behaviour of top earners is crucial:

AI will increase inequalities increase if:

- top earners are (comparatively) less exposed
- top earners capture high returns on AI capital accumulation

Social Mobility is important
