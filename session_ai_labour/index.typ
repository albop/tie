- build a common narrative that countries can build on to negociate with the same language
  - provide a discussion forum when there isnâ€™t one
- \(usually not) state an official position of the institution

The IMF is a global organization that works to achieve sustainable growth and prosperity for all of its 190 member countries.

- Conceptual framework: O\*NET content model

  - an occupation \(a job) is associated to a particular content \(skills, abilities, tasks, activities, context)
  - some content relates to the worker, some to the nature of the occupation
  - data comes from incumbant and experts

]
== How can you measure AI fitness for a job?
<how-can-you-measure-ai-fitness-for-a-job>
Which content is more relevant to judge AI fitness?

- skills
- abilities
- tasks

A growing body of literature \(led by Autor , Levy, Murnane 2003) is using content of jobs to assess the potential effect of new technologies.

== Earlier work has focused on tasks
<earlier-work-has-focused-on-tasks>
Earlier work has focused on tasks.

- â€¦ for automation
- â€¦ for machine learning

== Example
<example>
#emph[What Can Machines Learn and What Does It Mean for Occupations and the Economy?];, 2018 Erik Brynjolfsson, Tom Mitchell, and Daniel Rock

From O\*NET database \(occupational information)

- 964 #emph[occupations] ,decomposed 18,156 #emph[tasks]
- Tasks agggregated into of 2,069 work activities
  - ex: sort information, show empathy

Use human judgment to measure the suitability for machine learning of each task.

== Human Judgment
<human-judgment>
#image("assets/mturk.webp")

In practice, human judgment is replaced with Amazon Turk or CrowdFlower

#box(width: 100%,image("assets/result__distribution.png"))

== Examples: Conclusions
<examples-conclusions>
Almost no

- fully replaceable occupation
- fully ML immune occupation

All the distribution of income exposed.

The results are typical from the literature.

== Abilities
<abilities>
IMF Paper looks at #strong[abilities]

Paper builds on #emph[Occupational, industry, and geographic exposure to artificial intelligence: A novel dataset and its potential uses];, by Felten, Raj, and Seamans 2021.

Main idea: try to assess the adequacy of AI for each ability.

== Construct AI suitability index
<construct-ai-suitability-index>
AI exposure of ability $k$:

$ A I E O_k = sum_j L_(k j) A I_j $

where:

- $L_(k j)$: ability content of task $k$
- $A I_j$: suitability of $j$ for ability $j$

. . .

How do we measure AI abilities?

== 
<section-5>
#image("assets/eff.svg")

The Electronic Frontier Foundation \(EFF) is a well-regarded digital rights nonprofit that was founded in 1990,

As one of its activities, the EFF collects and maintains statistics about the progress of AI across separate artificial intelligence applications.

Each AI application has an index corresponding to AI development.

== Mapping EFF application definitions to ONET abilities
<mapping-eff-application-definitions-to-onet-abilities>
Human Judgment \(mturk) is used to associate each each of the $l in [1 , 10]$ EFF application to the $j in [1 , 51]$ O\*NET categories: $x_(l , j)$

In practice, human judgment come from `mturk`.

AI suitability for ability $j$ is then defined as $ A I_j = sum_(l = 1)^10 x_(l , j) $

<complementarity-augmented-ai-exposure>
The main contribution from the Pizzilnelli et al.~paper : use more content from O\*NET:

- work context: \*physical and social factors that influence the nature of work
- job zones: groups of occupations characterized by similar levels of education, on-the-job training, and professional experience needed to perform the work

Some contexts #emph[shield] workers from being replaced by AI

== 
<section-7>
Each O\*NET occupation is associated with each of the following context by a 0-100 score:

- Communication
- Responsibility
- Physical Conditions
- Criticality
- Routine
- Skills

. . .

The final complementarity score is the average of all contexts, normalized to be between 0 and 1.
