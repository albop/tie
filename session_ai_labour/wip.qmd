##  Example 

*What Can Machines Learn and What Does It Mean for Occupations and the Economy?*, 2018 Erik Brynjolfsson, Tom Mitchell, and Daniel Rock

- from O*NET database (occupational information)
  - 964 *occupations*
  - decomposed 18,156 *tasks*
  - made of 2,069 work activities
    - ex: sort information, show empathy

## Example (2)

- Crowdflower: evaluate work activities by answering
  - 23 distinct statements to be evaluated on a 5-point scale varying from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.”
  - example: is repetitive, requires data, requires physical action

## Example (2)

![](assets/result__occupations.png)

. . .

Almost no

- fully replaceable occupation
- fully ML immune occupation

----


## Who is going to be replaced? (3) Results

![](assets/result__distribution.png)

- everybody is at risk
- very different from effect of automation in the 90s
  - polarization effect on the work force: disappearance of intermediary jobs
  - effect *might* work in reverse

---


## Which jobs can be replaced?
 
Simplified view:

- automation: all routine jobs
- machine learning: anything that is a process
- gen AI: ???

Why are ML/AI so good?
  - they don't require much formalism
  - Polanyi's paradox: we know more than we can tell
  - ML/AI is good in Polanyi's situations.

## Shortcomings

- Many studies have found similar results. 
  - check out all "future of work", post 2018
  - each paper focus on different element of content

- Shortcomings:
  - only "displacement" effect
    - no complementarity
  - static view: it ignores
    - cretion of new jobs and job mobility
    - redifinition of job content





## Mobility## Other studies measuring complementarity?

...



Who can easily switch job ?

## Equilibrium Effects

Effect of new technology:
- on tasks / on jobs

- complement (worker stays in place)
- substitute (worker loose jobs)

task-substitution == displacement effect (Acemoglu and Restrepo ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AUTOMATION AND WORK)

Counter-balancing effects:
- productivity-effect
- capital accumulation
- deepening of automation

Reinstatement Effect


Outcomes:
- Creation of new jobs that are more complement / non-substitutable


## Simplified View

(after Acemolu and Loebbing)

- automation: routine tasks
  - middle class
    - easy to replace
    - not too cheap to invest
- machine learning: anything that is *a process*
  - prediction?
- gen AI: 
  - ???
