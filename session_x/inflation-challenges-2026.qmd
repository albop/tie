## Challenge #3 — energy, geopolitics & trade policy volatility

- Energy can swing headline inflation quickly (down *or* up)
- Geopolitical shocks hit commodities and supply chains first
- Trade policy and tariffs can reintroduce price pressure (and uncertainty)

::: notes
Talk track (2 minutes):

- In the euro area flash estimate for Jan 2026, energy is negative while services is still high: that’s the “headline looks fine, underlying still sticky” pattern.
- Even if inflation is near target, energy and trade shocks are still *tail risks* that force central banks to stay cautious.

Sources:

- Eurostat flash estimate shows energy inflation at -4.1% y/y and services at 3.2% y/y in Jan 2026.

- IMF WEO Update (Jan 2026) highlights that geopolitical tensions and trade measures can disrupt supply chains and commodity prices.

:::

## Challenge #4 — food prices, climate shocks, and “renewed” inflation risk

- Food inflation is socially and politically high-stakes
- Climate patterns (e.g., El Niño) can hit harvests and global food prices
- Even if overall markets are well supplied, shocks can be sharp and localized

::: notes
Talk track (2 minutes):

- Treat food and energy as “fast-moving” inflation components: the macro trend can be down while household experience jumps month-to-month.

Sources:

- ECB Economic Bulletin focus box discusses how El Niño can affect global food commodities and prices.

- World Bank food security update summarizes recent commodity market conditions and ongoing input-cost issues.

:::

## Challenge #5 — business stress: margins, refinancing, insolvencies

- The inflation hangover shows up in **cash flow** (input costs) and **credit** (refinancing at higher rates)
- A slowdown + tight credit conditions tend to hit SMEs first
- Rising bankruptcies create second-round effects: job losses, supplier defaults, tighter lending

::: notes
Talk track (2–3 minutes):

- Emphasize that “inflation problems” aren’t only about CPI prints; they show up in business failures and labor-market scarring.

Source:

- Allianz Global Insolvency Outlook 2026-27 expects global business insolvencies to rise +6% in 2025 and +5% in 2026, reaching record highs, with higher interest rates straining debt-heavy firms.

:::

## Challenge #6 — fiscal pressure: the “interest bill” problem

- Governments face tighter trade-offs: debt service vs. investment vs. social support
- Broad subsidies can reduce pain *now* but may worsen inflation or debt sustainability
- Fiscal-monetary mix matters more when inflation is close to target

::: notes
Talk track (2 minutes):

- The 2021–2023 inflation episode left higher price levels, and the response left higher interest rates for longer.
- That makes the cost of debt a constraint, and it feeds back into growth and social cohesion.

Sources:

- IMF blog (Apr 2025) notes rising debt levels and that high interest rates can limit essential spending on social programs and public investment.
  https://www.imf.org/en/blogs/articles/2025/04/23/rising-global-debt-requires-countries-to-put-their-fiscal-house-in-order
- IMF Fiscal Monitor media center notes that interest rates have increased considerably and the interest bill outlook is uncertain.

## Central banks in 2026: disinflation, but no victory lap

- **Fed:** holding **3.5%–3.75%**, with inflation “somewhat elevated”
- **BoE:** Bank Rate **3.75%**; sees inflation returning near target, but watches wage/services persistence
- **ECB:** deposit facility **2.00%** (current operational anchor)

![](images/imf_inflation_dynamics_diverge_fig5.png){width=75% fig-alt="IMF WEO Update (Jan 2026) Figure 5: Inflation dynamics diverge"}

::: notes
Talk track (2–3 minutes):

- This is the “tightrope”: cut too early and risk persistence; wait too long and risk unnecessary slowdown + financial stress.
- Use the IMF chart to highlight that inflation paths differ by economy—so policy is less synchronized than in the early post-pandemic tightening phase.

Sources:

- Fed FOMC statement (Jan 28, 2026): target range 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent; inflation remains somewhat elevated.

## Disinflation ≠ relief: the price level is the problem

- People experience *levels* (rent, groceries, energy bills), not just *rates*
- High-price essentials crowd out discretionary spending
- Perceived unfairness (“prices imposed”) becomes a political and workplace issue

::: notes
Talk track (2 minutes):

- Inflation falling from 8% to 2% does not rewind prices — it slows the *rate of further increases*.
- That helps central banks, but households still face a higher baseline for necessities.

Good prompt for discussion: “What costs feel *structural* for your team/customers?”

- TIME affordability article provides examples of persistent level effects (housing, energy, food) and ongoing salience even as inflation cools.

:::

## Challenge #1 — the “last mile”: services inflation & wages

- Services inflation is still high in many advanced economies
- Wage growth and inflation expectations matter more when goods disinflation fades
- Policy risk: easing too soon can re-ignite persistence

::: notes
Talk track (2 minutes):

- Goods prices normalized as supply chains healed; now the remaining pressure is often “domestic” (services + labor costs).
- Services is also where measurement and lags can be trickier.

Anchors:

- Eurostat flash: services inflation in the euro area was 3.2% in Jan 2026.
  https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-euro-indicators/w/2-04022026-ap
- ECB speech (Jun 2025): headline around target, but services inflation “still has some distance to travel” for sustainable target stabilization.

- Bank of England MPR (Feb 2026): notes services price inflation and wage growth still need to fall further for confidence about sustainable 2%.
  https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-report/2026/february-2026
:::

## Challenge #2 — housing: the slow-moving inflation engine

- Housing is both a price-level shock *and* a monetary-policy transmission channel
- Supply constraints make housing inflation “sticky”
- Higher rates can cool demand, but can also suppress new supply (construction) and keep rents elevated

::: notes
Talk track (2–3 minutes):

- In many places, housing is the dominant driver of “unaffordability,” even when headline inflation is near target.
- Housing also links directly to wage bargaining and labor mobility.

Use one concrete statistic to make the point:

- TIME cites U.S. home prices up about 45% since 2020 as a key driver of affordability stress.
  https://time.com/collections/davos-2026/7339214/global-affordability-crisis-cost-of-living-inflation-politics/

- Bank of England discusses how restrictive policy continues to weigh on interest-rate-sensitive consumption/investment (transmission lags still matter).

## Where inflation stands right now (Jan/Feb 2026 snapshot)

- **Euro area:** headline **1.7%** y/y (flash, Jan 2026)
- **UK:** CPI inflation **3.4%** (Dec) — expected back around **2%** from April
- **US:** Fed funds target range held at **3.5%–3.75%** (Jan FOMC)
- **Global:** headline inflation expected to decline from **4.1% (2025)** → **3.8% (2026)**

## A quick picture: what’s driving euro-area inflation now?

![](images/eurostat_hicp_components_jan2026.png){width=85% fig-alt="Euro area inflation components, January 2026 (Eurostat)"}

::: notes
Use this slide to make the key point: energy can drag headline down, while services stays elevated.

What to say:

- Headline can look “solved,” but underlying domestically-driven components (especially services) can stay sticky.

## Practical playbook (what to do with this)

- **Pricing & contracts:** shorten price locks, use indexation where acceptable, monitor competitor resets
- **Wages & retention:** focus on essentials (housing/transport/childcare), communicate total rewards clearly
- **Procurement & supply:** dual-source critical inputs; build “shock clauses” for energy/transport
- **Finance:** review debt maturities; stress-test cash flow under “rates stay high” + “growth slows” scenarios
- **Customer & citizen empathy:** redesign journeys around affordability (smaller packs, cheaper tiers, flexible plans)

::: notes
This is the “so what” slide. Invite the room to pick one action per area.

Prompt: “If inflation stays near target but prices remain high, what do we change first?”
:::

## Five takeaways to land

1. Lower inflation doesn’t mean lower prices — affordability can stay politically and economically dominant.
2. The remaining inflation risk is increasingly *domestic*: services, wages, housing.
3. “Shockable” components (energy/food/trade) still drive volatility and policy caution.
4. Higher rates are now part of the inflation story: refinancing stress, insolvencies, and fiscal constraints.
5. The winning strategy is resilience: scenario planning + flexibility in pricing, supply, and balance sheets.

::: notes
If you have time for Q&A, ask:

- Which challenge is biggest for *your* sector: housing, labor, energy, or financing?
