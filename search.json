There are many reasons why this may not be feasible. In particular, rich countries have accumulated a stock of emissions over the past centuries and should support a stronger effort, while poor countries need to catch up in terms of income in order to reach the technical level they need to efficiently cap their missions.\ncarbon leakage: - the direct leakage problem - sectors under constraint displace their production in regions where the constraint is less binding - indirect leakage problem is related to energy markets - by reducing their demand in fossil energy, regulating countries depress its price, which leads indirectly to higher emissions by nonconstrained countries\nCurrent policies: - energy intensive manufacturing: ETS system - free allowances to high-emitting industries - member states: - carbon taxation systems for services and non-tradable goods (housing, transport) - no measure at the border"
