# Introduction

How do you define Globalization?

[IMF Staff](https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/ib/2002/031502.htm#:~:text=Globalization%E2%80%94the%20process%20through%20which,IMF%20and%20the%20World%20Bank.) __2002__:

    Globalization—the process through which an increasingly free flow of ideas, people, goods, services, and capital leads to the integration of economies and societies—is often viewed as an irreversible force, which is being imposed upon the world by some countries and institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank.

. . .

    However, that is not so: globalization represents a political choice in favor of international economic integration, which for the most part has gone hand-in-hand with the consolidation of democracy.

the process through which an increasingly free flow of ideas, people, goods, services, and capital leads to the integration of economies and societies

*globalization is a* __political choice__ 

. . .

Several economic dimensions:

- increased trade
- financial flows
- migration

. . .

How do you measure Globalization?

## Balance of Payments

The  main source of data is the [*Balance of Payments*](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=62&step=6&isuri=1&tablelist=48&product=1).

It has three components

::: {.incremental}

- __current account__ 
  - aka trade balance (exports - imports)
- __financial account__
  - change in ownwership in domestic/foreign assets
- __capital account__
  - nonproduced nonfinancial assets and capital transfers between residents and nonresidents

# Geo-economic fragmentation and the world economy


## 

Aiyar et al. propose the following definition:

::: {.callout-note}

Policy-driven reversal of global economic integration often guided by strategic considerations.

:::

- domestic policy objective
- no *autonomous* shift in preferences or technology
- not an effect of *prudential policies*


##

Which were the more recent geopolitical shocks?

discuss whether the definition applies.

__Relocation Decisions__ in international business and management literature (from ![European Parliement](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/653626/EXPO_STU(2021)653626_EN.pdf)):

- __reshoring__: bringing industries and value-creating activities ‘home’ to a specific location 
- __backshoring__: activities return to their initial country of origin
- __nearshoring__: occurs when manufacturing is relocated to a country closer to ‘home’


##

What are the costs of fragmentation?

. . .

Essentially the opposite of the gains from trade and financial integration?[^authors_point_of_view]

. . .

What are they?


[^authors_point_of_view]: this is the point of view from the authors...


## Neo-Classical Gains

:::{.incremental}

- international trade:
  
  - in final goods: increase welfare thanks to the preference for variety of consumers
  - in intermediary goods: optimize supply chain

- international finance:

  - allocate capital more efficiently
  - provide risk-sharing

- migration:

  - reallocate labour force more efficiently

:::

::: notes

Explain Comparative Advantage

:::

## {auto-animate="true"}

Can we measure those gains?

. . .

![Exports vs Growth](assets/gdp_vs_exports.png)

::::
:::: {.column width=70%}

::::: {.incremental}

Just a motivational plot:

- Lots of outliers
- What about reverse causality?
- Common result in international trade:
  - integration benefits the country producing the good that that is more valued (and more exported)...
  - ... and export more
  

:::::

::::

:::

## 

Is it even possible to measure the gains from integration? Big long-standing debate:

- what is the counterfactual?
- a model is needed

##

__Trade__

::: {.enumerate}

- static models: (gravity model, CGE, new trade models)
  - direct sizable gains
  - short term analysis
- recent studies focus on (unequal) distribution of gains
  - among countries
  - within countries
- all effects are dwarfed compared with dynamic effects
  - productivity gains / technology diffusion
  - but few recent empirical studies

:::

## Does trade cause inequality?

From *The Distribution of Gains from Globalization* 2018, by Lang and Tavares.

## 

__Finance / Capital Allocation__

- gains are rather small in classical theoretical models at odd with economists' beliefs
  - *The Elusive Gains from International Financial Integration*, Gourinchas and Jeanne, 2004
  - *Financial Integration in a Risky World*, Coeurdacier, Rey and Winant, 2020
    - Small welfare gains from capital reallocation and risk-sharing. And and developped, safe, countries benefit more...

## 

__Finance / Capital Allocation__


- and financial integration might have even have increased correlation between asset prices across borders
  - see *Global Financial Cycle*, Miranda-Aggripino, Rey, 2022



## What would be the cost of Cold War II?

Four studies:

- IMF2022
- [Bolhuis et al](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/03/24/Fragmentation-in-Global-Trade-Accounting-for-Commodities-531327) (2023)
- Cerdeiro et al. (2021)
- [Goes and Bekkers](https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/reser_e/ersd202209_e.htm) (2022)

Different Fragmentation Scenarios:

- In general West + China/US + Non-aligned.
- Nature of trade fragmentation is variable

::: notes

Take Bolhuis as example.
- basic CGE

- Losses (in the worst and best cases) are large
  
  - compare to the welfare costs/ gains in the Nordhaus model

- A big uncertainty is the calibration of __elasticities__

## Short term / long-term elasticities

__2021__: can Germany reduce its dependence on Russian Gas?

- industry: Imp-Pos-Sible
- top economists [What if Germany is cut off from Russian energy?](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/what-if-germany-cut-russian-energy)
  - cost: 0.2/0.3% of gdp / 80E per citizen
  - depends on elasticity

. . .

__2023__: (second-winter) Germany buys all its gas on world markets
  
. . .

__2030__: green transition ???

# Conclusion


##

![](assets/globalization_threatened.png)


##

Globalization has been *organized* through multilateral organizations

. . . 

- Trade: GATT (1945) then WTO
- Finance: IMF (1945)

. . .

These instutions have survived even though member states, have sometimes diverged politically.

<mark>1 trillions dollar question</mark>: how to save multilateralism when countries are pulling appart?

. . .

There are still big challenges that require a multilateral approach:

- green transition
  - cf Nordhaus, green clubs
- financing developing countries
- responding to a world pandemia

. . .

Options: diplomacy, green corridors...
